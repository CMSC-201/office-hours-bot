# Student Bot Help
Hello!  Discord is a online text and voice chat system originally designed for gamers -- we're using it to run office hours.

## Global commands
These are commands that can be run by all channel members.

### View the queue status
If you type `!status` you will be able to see how many students are waiting in the queue.  We are aware that this command leaves a lot to be desired and improving it is high on our TODO list.

### Viewing this help page
Typing `!help` will provide a link to role-specific help.

## Student commands
The following are commands useable to you to access the server and request help for office hours.

### Authentication
When you first join the server, you are put into the landing-pad room.  You should then switch to the authentication channel and authenticate.  You do this by typing `!auth [you code]`.

This is a one-time thing.  Once you are authenticated, you are assigned your real name and allowed into student spaces.

### Requesting Help
Once you are authenticated, you can go to the channel waiting-room, wherein you can use the `!request [description of you request]` command.  This will put you into a waiting queue to get help from course staff.

### Removing From Queue
If you are currently in the office hours queue and don't require help any more, you can remove yourself from the queue using `!retract_request`.
